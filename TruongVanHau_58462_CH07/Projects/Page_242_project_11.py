Problem:
            To enlarge an image, one must fill in new rows and columns with color
                information based on the colors of neighboring positions in the original image.
                Develop and test a function named enlarge. This function should expect an
                image and an integer factor as arguments. The function should build and return
                a new image that represents the expansion of the original image by the factor.
                (Hint: Copy each row of pixels in the original image to one or more rows in the
                new image. To copy a row, use two index variables, one that starts on the left
                of the row and one that starts on the right. These two indexes converge to the
                middle. This will allow you to copy each pixel to one or more positions of a row
                in the new image.)


Solution:
