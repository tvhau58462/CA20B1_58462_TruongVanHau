Problem:
            Darkening an image requires adjusting its pixels toward black as a limit, whereas
                lightening an image requires adjusting them toward white as a limit. Because
                black is RGB (0, 0, 0) and white is RGB (255, 255, 255), adjusting the three RGB
                values of each pixel by the same amount in either direction will have the desired
                effect. Of course, the algorithms must avoid exceeding either limit during the
                adjustments.
                 Lightening and darkening are actually special cases of a process known as color
                filtering. A color filter is any RGB triple applied to an entire image. The filtering
                algorithm adjusts each pixel by the amounts specified in the triple. For example,
                you can increase the amount of red in an image by applying a color filter with a
                positive red value and green and blue values of 0. The filter (20, 0, 0) would make
                an imageâ€™s overall color slightly redder. Alternatively, you can reduce the amount
                of red by applying a color filter with a negative red value. Once again, the algorithms must avoid exceeding the limits on the RGB values.
                 Develop three algorithms for lightening, darkening, and color filtering as three
                related Python functions, lighten, darken, and colorFilter. The first two
                functions should expect an image and a positive integer as arguments. The third
                function should expect an image and a tuple of integers (the RGB values) as arguments. The following session shows how these functions can be used with the
                images image1, image2, and image3, which are initially transparent:
                >>> image1 = Image(100, 50)
                >>> image2 = Image(100, 50)
                >>> image3 = Image(100, 50)
                >>> darken(image1, 128)                # Converts to gray
                >>> darken(image2, 64)                 # Converts to dark gray
                >>> colorFilter(image3, (255, 0, 0))   # Converts to red
                 Note that the function colorFilter should do most of the work.
