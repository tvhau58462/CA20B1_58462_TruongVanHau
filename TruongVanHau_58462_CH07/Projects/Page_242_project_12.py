Problem:
            Each image-processing function that modifies its image argument has the same
            loop pattern for traversing the image. The only thing that varies is the code used
            to change each pixel within the loop. Section 6.6 of this book, on higher-order
            functions, suggests a simpler design pattern for such code. Design a single function, named transform,
            which expects an image and a function as arguments.
            When this function is called, it should be passed another function that expects a
            tuple of integers and returns a tuple of integers. This is the function that transforms the information
            for an individual pixel (such as converting it to black and
            white or gray-scale). The transform function contains the loop logic for traversing its image argument.
            In the body of the loop, the transform function accesses
            the pixel at the current position, passes it as an argument to the other function,
            and resets the pixel in the image to the functionâ€™s value. Write and test a script
            that defines this function and uses it to perform at least two different types of
            transformation on an image.


Solution:


    ....
