Problem:
        Turtle graphics windows do not automatically expand in size. What do you suppose
            happens when a Turtle object attempts to move beyond a window boundary?


Solution:
        Turtle graphics system are Screen, which represents a turtle’s associated window, and Canvas, which represents
            the area in which a turtle can move and draw lines. A canvas can be larger than its window, which displays just
            the area of the canvas visible to the human user. We will have more to say about these two
            objects later, but first let’s examine how to create and manipulate a turtle in the IDLE shell.
