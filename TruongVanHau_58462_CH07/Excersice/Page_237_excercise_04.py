Problem:
        Describe how a row-major traversal visits every position in a two-dimensional grid.


Solution:
        A row-major traversal starts at position (0, 0) in a grid and visits each position in a given row before moving on to the next row.
        Thus, the next position visited, if there is one in the first row, would be ((0,1).
