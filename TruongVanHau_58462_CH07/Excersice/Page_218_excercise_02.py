Problem:
        What is object instantiation? What are the options at the programmer’s disposal
            during this process?


Solution:
        - Before you use some objects, like a Turtle object, you must create them. To be precise,
            you must create an instance of the object’s class. The process of creating an object is called
            instantiation.
        - In the programs you have seen so far in this book, Python automatically created
            objects such as numbers, strings, and lists when it encountered them as literals.
