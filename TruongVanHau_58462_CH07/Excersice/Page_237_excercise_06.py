Problem:
        Explain why one would use the clone method with a given object.


Solution:
        clone() method saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object.
        As you can see in the below example, both reference variables have the same value.
        If we create another object by new keyword and assign the values of another object to this one, it will require a lot of processing on this object
