Problem:
        How would a column-major traversal of a grid work? Write a code segment that
            prints the positions visited by a column-major traversal of a 2-by-3 grid.


Solution:
        A column-major traversal starts at position (0,0) in a grid and visits each position in a column before moving on to the next column.
        Here is a loop that prints the positions of a 2 by 3 grid in column-major order.
