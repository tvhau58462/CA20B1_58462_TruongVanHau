Problem:
        Describe the difference between Cartesian coordinates and screen coordinates


Solution:
        A bit In the Cartesian coordinate system, the origin point (0,0) is at the center of the viewing area.
        The y-coordinates increase in positive numbers above the x-axis and in negative numbers below the x-axis.
        In the screen coordinate system, the origin point (0,0) is at the upper left corner of the viewing area.
        The y-coordinates increase in positive numbers below the x-axis and in negative numbers above the x-axis.
        In both systems, the x-coordinates increase in positive numbers to the right of the y-axis and in negative numbers
            to the left of the y-axis
