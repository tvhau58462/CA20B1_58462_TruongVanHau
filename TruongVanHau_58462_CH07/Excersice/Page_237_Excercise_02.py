Problem:
        The size of an image is 1680 pixels by 1050 pixels. Assume that this image has been
            sampled using the RGB color system and placed into a raw image file. What is the
            minimum size of this file in megabytes? (Hint: There are 8 bits in a byte, 1024 bits in
            a kilobyte, and 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte.)


Solution:
        The size of an image is 1680 pixels x 1050 pixels = 1764000 pixels
        
        1764000  pixels X 16 bit = 28224000 รท (8 x 1024) = 3445.3125 Kilobytes รท 1000 = 3.445 Megabytes
