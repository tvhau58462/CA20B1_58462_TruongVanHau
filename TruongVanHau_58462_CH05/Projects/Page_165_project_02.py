Problem:
        Write a program that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The
            program should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a
            list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the
            file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to
            the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the
            program prints the line associated with that number.


Solution:

    ....
