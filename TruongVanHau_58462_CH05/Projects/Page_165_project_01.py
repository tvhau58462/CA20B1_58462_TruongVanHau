Problem:
        A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions
            that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, as defined in Section
            5.4. Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function
            named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function
            should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each
            function should return 0 if the list is empty. Include a main function that tests the
            three statistical functions with a given list


Solution:

    ....
