Problem:
        Explain the difference between structural equivalence and object identity


Solution:
        - The object identity is meant for a situation where the structure of the object is not encapsulated.
            Here, the 2 objects are meant to be in the same object based on having the identical properties.

        - Structural equivalence is meant for extending the 2 specified nodes which are connected to the
            similar social environment which is hypothesized for the structural equivalence nodes.
