Problem:
        The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period
            in a text file. The format of each line of the file is the following:
            <last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
            Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a
            report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report should
            be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain an
            employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.


Solution:


    ....
"""

file_name = input('Enter input file name: ')

# print the header on terminal
print('\n%-15s%-10s%-10s' % ('Name', 'Hours', 'Total Pay'))

# open the file and iterate line by line
for line in open(file_name):
    line = line.strip()

    # if line is not blank
    if line != '':
        # split the line and capture each group
        (nm, wage, hours) = line.split()

        # name is in string, while wage and hours next
        # to be converted form stirng to float
        wage = float(wage)
        hours = int(hours)
        pay = wage * hours

        print('%-15s%-10d%-10.2f' % (nm, hours, pay))
