Problem:
        You are given a string that was encoded by a Caesar cipher with an unknown distance value.
        The text can contain any of the printable ASCII characters. Suggest an algorithm for cracking this code.


Solution:
        A more sophisticated encryption scheme is called a block cipher.
        A block cipher uses plaintext characters to compute two or more encrypter characters.
        This is accomplished by using a mathematical structure know as an invertible matrix to determine the values of
        the encrypted characters. The matrix provides the key in this method. The receiver uses the same matrix
        to decrypt the cipher text. The fact that information used to determine each character comes from a block of data
        makes it more difficult to determine the key.
