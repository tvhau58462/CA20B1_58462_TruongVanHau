Problem:
              Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra
                work. She says she can finish her programs much more quickly if she just writes
                them using the basic operators and control statements. State three reasons why her
                view is shortsighted.


Solution:
            -  Functions provide readability in the code (Readable Code)
            -  Functions avoid repetition in the code.
            -  Function can be given a convenient name that describes its use in the program.
