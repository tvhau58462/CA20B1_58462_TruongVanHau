Problem:
              Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function definition can support this property of an algorithm.

Solution:
                 An algorithm is a general method for solving a class of problems.
            The individual problems that make up a class of problems are known as problem instances.
            The problem instances for our summation algorithm are the pairs of numbers that specify
                the lower and upper bounds of the range of numbers to be summed.
            The problem instances of a given algorithm can vary from program to program,
                or even within different parts of the same program.
            When you design an algorithm, it should be general enough to provide a solution to many problem instances,
                not just one or a few of them. In other words, a function should provide a general method with systematic variations.
