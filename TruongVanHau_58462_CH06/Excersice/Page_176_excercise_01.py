Problem:
              Draw a structure chart for one of the solutions to the programming projects of
                Chapters 4 and 5. The program should include at least two function definitions
                other than the main function.


Solution:
            -  Functions provide readability in the code (Readable Code)
            -  Functions avoid repetition in the code.
            -  Function can be given a convenient name that describes its use in the program.
