Problem:
              What is the scope of a variable? Give an example.


Solution:
            Variables have a global or local "scope".

            Example: variables declared within either the setup() or draw() functions may be only used in these functions.
                    Global variables, variables declared outside of setup() and draw(), may be used anywhere within the program
