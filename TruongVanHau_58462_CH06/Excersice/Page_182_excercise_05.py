Problem:
              Explain what happens when the following recursive function is called with the value 4 as an argument:
                def example(n):
                    if n > 0:
                        print(n)
                        example(n)
                    else:
                        example(n - 1)


Solution:
            -  n = 4 > 0, function will be called many times and print many value = 4
