Problem:
              Describe the costs and benefits of defining and using a recursive function.


Solution:
            -  The run-time system on a real computer, such as the PVM, must devote some overhead to recursive function calls.
                At program startup, the PVM reserves an area of memory named a call stack.
                For each call of a function, recursive or otherwise, the PVM must allocate
                 on the call stack a small chunk of memory called a stack frame.
            -  A recursive solution might be simpler and no less efficient.
                Recursion is a very powerful design technique that is used throughout computer science.
