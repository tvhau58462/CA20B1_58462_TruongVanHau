Problem:
              What is the lifetime of a variable? Give an example


Solution:
            Variables have a global or local "scope".

            Example: Variables declared within either the setup() or draw() functions may be only used in these functions.
                    Global variables, variables declared outside of setup() and draw(), may be used anywhere within the program.
                    If a local variable is declared with the same name as a global variable, the program will use the local
                        variable to make its calculations within the current scope.
                    Variables are localized within each block, the space between a { and }.
