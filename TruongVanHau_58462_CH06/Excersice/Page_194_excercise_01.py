Problem:
              Where are module variables, parameters, and temporary variables introduced and
                    initialized in a program?


Solution:
            TEMPORARY VARIABLES :
            INTRODUCED : inside a block, they have very short lifetime and hold data that can be discarded or is later stored in a permanent variable
            INITIALIZED : temporary variables can be initialized anywhere inside the block where they are declared.

            PARAMETERS:
            INTRODUCED : parameters are declared inside the parenthesis of the function definition
            INITIALIZED : parameters can be initialized where they are declared or can be declared in the parenthesis of the function call

            MODULE VARIABLE :
            INTRODUCED : A module-level variable is declared for a particular module. It is available to all procedures within that module
                        but not to the rest of the application. Module-level variables remain in existence for the lifetime of the application and preserve their values.
            INITIALIZED : module variable gets initialized where they are declared inside the module. it is initialized to 0 by default.
