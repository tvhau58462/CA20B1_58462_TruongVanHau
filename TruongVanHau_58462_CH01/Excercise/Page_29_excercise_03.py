Problem:
   Answer the question, What is a Python script?

Solution:
    1. A Python script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed like a program. The file can of course contain functions and import various modules, but the idea is that it will be run or executed from the command line or from within a Python interactive shell to perform a specific task.
    2. Often a script first contains a set of function definitions and then has the main program that might call the functions.
