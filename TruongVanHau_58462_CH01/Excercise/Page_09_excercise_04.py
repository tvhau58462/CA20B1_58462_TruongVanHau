Problem:
   What is the difference between a terminal-based interface and a graphical user interface?

Solution:
    A terminal-based interface accepts inputs from a keyboard and displays text output on a monitor screen.

    A graphical user interface (GUI) organizes the monitor screen around the metaphor of a desktop, with windows containing icons for folders, files, and applications.
