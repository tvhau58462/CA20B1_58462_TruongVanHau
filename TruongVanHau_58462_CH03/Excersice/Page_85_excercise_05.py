Problem:
        Explain how to check for an invalid input number and prevent it being used in a program.
        You may assume that the user enters a number.

Solution:
        Often a course of action must be taken if either of two conditions is true.
        For example, valid inputs to a program often lie within a given range of values.
        Any input above this range should be rejected with an error message,
            and any input below this range should be dealt with in a similar fashion.
        The next code segment accepts only valid inputs for our grade conversion script and displays an error message.
