Problem:
        Describe the purpose of the break statement and the type of problem for which it is well suited.

Solution:
        The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop. ...
        If you are using nested loops, the break statement stops the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.
