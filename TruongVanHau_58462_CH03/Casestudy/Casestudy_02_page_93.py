Problem:
        Users of pocket calculators or Pythonâ€™s math module do not have to think about how
to compute square roots, but the people who built those calculators or wrote the
code for that module certainly did. In this case study, we open the hood and see how
this might be done.
        Write a program that computes square roots.

Solution:
        Compute the square root of a number.
            1. The input is a number.
            2. The outputs are the program's estimate of the square root
                using Newton's method of successive approximations, and
                Python's own estimate using math.sqrt.

#Perform the successive approximations
while True:

    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
