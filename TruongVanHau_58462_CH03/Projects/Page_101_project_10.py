Problem:
        The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and an annual interest rate of 12%.
        Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price, minus the down payment. Write a program that takes the purchase price as input.
        The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a payment schedule for the lifetime of the loan.
        Each row of the table should contain the following
items:
 • the month number (beginning with 1)
 • the current total balance owed
 • the interest owed for that month
 • the amount of principal owed for that month
 • the payment for that month
 • the balance remaining after payment
        The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance * rate / 12.
        The amount of principal for a month is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed.


Solution:


    ....
