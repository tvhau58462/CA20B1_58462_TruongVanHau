Problem:
        List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they accomplish.

Solution:
        1. Analysis: The programmers determine what the program will do.
            This is sometimes viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem.
        2. Design: The programmers determine how the program will do its task.
        3. Implementation: The programmers write the program. This step is also called the coding phase.
        4. Integration: Large programs have many parts.
            In the integration phase, these parts are brought together into a smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.
